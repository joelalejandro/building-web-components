# building-web-components

This is a branched, iterative repo of demos, showing examples about [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com). Use `git checkout -f` to navigate through the branches in your favourite shell or explore them with the GitHub branch list.

- [`01-vanillajs`](https://github.com/joelalejandro/building-web-components/tree/01-vanillajs) contains a basic example of a Web Component with embedded styles using Shadow DOM.
- [`02-props`](https://github.com/joelalejandro/building-web-components/tree/02-props) shows how to add a prop using HTML attributes with some basic level of data binding.
- [`03-events`](https://github.com/joelalejandro/building-web-components/tree/03-events) uses `CustomEvent` and `dispatchEvent()` from the Events API to add custom behaviour to a Web Component.
- [`04-custom-component-class`](https://github.com/joelalejandro/building-web-components/tree/04-custom-component-class) presents an attempt on a `Component` wrapper class to contain generic functionality needed to build any Web Component (a crude approximation to what a component compiler such a Stencil pretends to do).
- [`05-stencil`](https://github.com/joelalejandro/building-web-components/tree/05-stencil/demo-component) introduces Stencil, and its initial scaffolding, along with a demo component and its test cases.
